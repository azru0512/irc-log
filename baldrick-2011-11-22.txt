19:30 < chenwj> baldrick: hi!
19:30 <@baldrick> yo chenwj!
19:30 < chenwj> XD
19:30 <@baldrick> chenwj: did your trip back go OK?
19:30 < chenwj> yup
19:31 < chenwj> but it's a loooong trip
19:31 < chenwj> takes 1x hours on the plane
19:32 <@baldrick> chenwj: my trip back was long too - I started to have dark thoughts about the LLVM meeting, wondering if it was worth it, after about 10
                  hours :)
19:33 < chenwj> really?
19:33 < chenwj> I think it's worth for me, at least I see you face to face. XD
19:34 <@baldrick> :)
19:35 <@baldrick> yes, it's great to be able to put faces to names
