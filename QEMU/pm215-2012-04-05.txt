23:25 < chenwj_> fighting with pandaboard...
23:28 < pm215> I spent a morning earlier this week trying to boot a beagleboard before I found out that you have to hold down the 'user' button to get it to
               boot from mmc rather than flash...
23:29 < pm215> (if TI printed version register values in their TRMs I wouldn't have had to bother...)
23:30 < chenwj_> can qemu emulate beagleboard or pandaboard?
23:31 < pm215> qemu-linaro can do beagleboard. panda is an omap4 and nobody afaik has modelled that yet
23:31 < afaerber> chenwj_: I got an armStoneA8 board this week; it's an industrial board where you need to attach by screw the individual power wires - we
                  already cut an old notebook power supply for a Toradex Iris board recently, but this one needs exactly 5V now...
23:32 < chenwj_> well, tou remind me I gave the pandaboard a 12V power supply
23:33 -!- arsdmthe_ is now known as arsdmthe
23:33 < pm215> I thought the panda was 5V like the beagle...
23:34 < fidencio> pm215: you're right
23:36 < afaerber> chenwj_, that's why I'm saying it, trying to avoid it myself ;)
23:36 < afaerber> 19V here
