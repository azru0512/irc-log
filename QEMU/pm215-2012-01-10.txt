18:33 < chenwj> can I exit (logout) the guest OS without rebooting? I tried linux-0.2.img, when I logout Qemu start rebooting.
18:34 < pm215> cor, the mailing list is being slow today (lists.gnu sat on one of my mails for eight hours last night)
18:34 < pm215> chenwj: reboot/shutdown/etc is board and guest OS dependent
18:35 < pm215> when the board being modelled has some sort of 'power off' facility and qemu's model of the board implements it and the guest OS uses it,
               then telling the guest OS to power down should cause qemu to exit to the host OS command line
18:37 < chenwj> I mean type "exit" on the promote to logout the guest os
18:37 < pm215> on the what?
18:37 < chenwj> $ exit <- like thos
18:37 < chenwj> this
18:37 < pm215> yes, type that where?
18:37 < chenwj> on the guest os
18:38 < pm215> that will just do whatever the guest OS does when you type exit at a prompt (usually put you back at a guest OS login prompt)
18:39 < chenwj> pm215: that's what I thought, but linux-0.2.img doesn't behave like that
18:40 < pm215> well, behaviour of 'exit' is entirely a guest config and setup issue
18:40 < chenwj> the image I get form http://landley.net/aboriginal/ also does rebooting when I type exit
18:41 < pm215> if 'shutdown -h now' shuts qemu down and exits, then qemu is doing its part, and it's purely a guest os issue what it does when you type
               'exit'
18:43 < chenwj> you mean I can make "exit" rebooting rather than put me back at login prompt when I do make kernel config or something like that?
18:44 < chenwj> pm215: got to go, byebye
18:44 < pm215> what 'exit' does is userspace config, not kernel
