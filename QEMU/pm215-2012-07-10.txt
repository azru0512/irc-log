19:30 < chenwj> is it possible to measure how much time QEMU spend on IO emulation?
19:34 < pm215> you might be able to get some plausible results with the aid of a profiler, since the IO emulation is basically all C code
19:35 < chenwj> like gprof?
19:36 < pm215> gprof's pretty old these days
19:37 < chenwj> that's reasonable. for CPU stuff, we cannot use usual profiling way since the execution is in the code cache not function calls
19:39 < chenwj> any idea on what C functions I should look into?
19:41 < pm215> not offhand. you basically want to identify the point in the slowpath that corresponds to 'we need to do an IO emulation call', and then try
               to capture time spent in that and all of its callees
19:42 < pm215> easiest way to do this might be to do a run under callgrind and then starting at something that's definitely a device work up the call-graph
               representation until you find something plausible to use as a start point
19:42 < chenwj> is there only IO thread in QEMU?
