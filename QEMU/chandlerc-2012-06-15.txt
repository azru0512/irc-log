17:39 < chandlerc> guess what is a BAD FREAKING IDEA
17:39 < chandlerc> allocating memory in your signal handler
17:42 < chenwj> why it's bad?
17:42 < chandlerc> uh
17:42 < chandlerc> signal handler
17:42 < chandlerc> it has to be async signal safe
17:42 < chandlerc> calling 'malloc' or 'new' isn't
17:42 < chandlerc> for example, your malloc implementation might receive a signal while holding a lock
17:42 < chandlerc> kinda bad to re-enter it
17:43 < jMCg> *sigh*
17:43 < chandlerc> yea
17:43 < jMCg> chandlerc: who does that?
17:43  * chandlerc is trying to fix
17:43 < chandlerc> oh, you know, *all of LLVM and every tool using it*
17:43 < jMCg> Oh.
