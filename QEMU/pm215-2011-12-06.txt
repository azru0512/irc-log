18:05 < chenwj> one question. how long can I ping someone if my patch being ignored?
18:08 < pm215> chenwj: roughly speaking, the system assumes that as the submitter you continue to ping indefinitely
18:08 < pm215> (assuming that it's not being ignored because you've failed to deal with review comments from previous versions, for example)
18:09 < pm215> the 1.0 freeze has obviously meant we've not been applying patches for a while but that should start to unblock now
18:19 < pm215> chenwj: (which patch, by the way?)
18:56 < chenwj> pm215: http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.qemu/124321
18:56 < chenwj> so what should I do? resent the patch or?
18:57 < chenwj> and this one http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.qemu/125400
19:07 < pm215> you should check that the patches still apply to current master. if they don't then you need to redo them against master (rebase them). if
               the old patches do still apply cleanly you can just follow up to them with a 'ping?' email
19:07 < pm215> make sure you cc relevant maintainers (riku for linux-user)
19:07 < chenwj> ok
19:08 < chenwj> redo means I should resent the patch?
19:09 < chenwj> if so, should I change the version number?
19:11 < pm215> redo> if you have to change the text of the patches you need to resend them, obviously, and bump the version number
19:11 < pm215> if the patches you sent last time apply exactly still then they're ok and need not be resent
19:11 < pm215> by 'redo' I mean 'stg rebase' or 'git rebase' or whatever set of git tools you use to maintain your patches
19:12 < chenwj> i see
19:14 < chenwj> btw, it turns out the problem I mentioned on the mailing list is we don't consider cross page boundary in our optimization
19:14 < pm215> yeah, that's one of the tricky cases
19:14 < pm215> tcg ducks the issue by stopping at a page boundary
19:16 < chenwj> http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2011-12/msg00634.html
19:18 < chenwj> duck? I am not a native eng speaker
19:19 < pm215> avoid
19:22 < chenwj> not worth to track cross page block linking? as Max said in https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2011-09/msg03208.html
19:23 < davidgiluk> chenwj, It depends, some parts change mapping often, some things don't - e.g. it's probably worth it in the kernel for example
19:24 < chenwj> you mean system mode emulation?
19:24 < davidgiluk> yes; in user mode emulation it's probably worth it a lot of the time - but you have to be careful to cope with the rare cases someone
                    changes the mapping
19:26 < chenwj> tlb mapping?
19:28 < davidgiluk> chenwj, yes (although in user I guess it just thinking about it from a mmap point of view than actually thinking of TLBs)
