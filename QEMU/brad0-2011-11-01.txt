20:11 < chenwj> is glib2.0 not optional anymore?
20:15 < brad0> not optional anymore.
20:18 < chenwj> why?
20:19 < chenwj> I see diable-user-agent doesn't need glib2.0 in QEMU 0.15
20:19 < brad0> with 0.15 it was optional.
20:19 < brad0> with HEAD code and what will be 1.0 its no longer optional.
20:20 < chenwj> any reason why they decide glib2.0 is no longer optional?
20:21 < brad0> with 0.15 it was only used a little bit by the agent code. with HEAD glib is use is more pervasive with QEMU.
20:22 < chenwj> hmmm, on my linux/sparc there is no glib package
20:22 < brad0> then you'll have to install it.
20:22 < chenwj> I'll try
20:22 < chenwj> thanks
20:42 < stefanha> chenwj: All of QEMU uses g_malloc() now so it's not optional anymore
20:42 < stefanha> glib provides a lot of portable, tested infrastructure which QEMU can take advantage of.
20:42 < chenwj> ok
20:46 < chenwj> how do I pass the path of glib I build while configuring QEMU?
20:46 < chenwj> --extra-cflags or ?
20:46 < stefanha> chenwj: Yes
20:47 < stefanha> Why is glib not available in your normal compiler search paths?
20:49 < chenwj> I am on a Linux/Sparc machine
20:49 < chenwj> it's package does not have glib
20:49 < chenwj> I have download the source and build it myself
20:50 < malc> chenwj: if you are using gcc you can just set CPATH and LIBRARY_PATH environment variables
20:57 < chenwj> seems there is a reason why the package doesn't have glib
