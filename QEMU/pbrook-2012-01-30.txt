18:09 < chenwj> what's qom? qemu object model?
18:11 < crocket> qom?!!!
18:11 < pm215> qemu object model> yes
18:17 < chenwj> what's the relationship between qdev and qom? I see they are on the same page -> http://wiki.qemu.org/Features/QOM
18:18 < pbrook> qop replaces qdev.
18:18 < pbrook> s/qop/qom/
18:18 < chenwj> oh
18:21 < chenwj> pbrook: do you think writing this on the wiki is a good idea? I mean "qop replaces qdev".
18:22 < pbrook> *shrug*. I'd have thought that was fairly obvious.
18:23 < pbrook> What would be more useful is an overview of what both are trying to achieve.
18:24 < pbrook> They're basically two implementations of the same thing.
18:25 < chenwj> I know they are both for device but don't know qom tends to replace qdev.
