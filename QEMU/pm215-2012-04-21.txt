00:51 < chenwj> pm215: why I can use "qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -m 2048M" in git head but not qemu 0.13?
00:51 < aliguori> pm215 is saying it's too much boiler plate code
00:52 < pm215> chenwj: I'm surprised that works in git head!
00:52 < pbrook> I'd expect that medium tem they'd go away anyway.
00:52 < chenwj> pm215: it shouldn't?
00:52 < chenwj> pm215: does arm board limit the memory size?
00:53 < pm215> the hardware has a max limit of 128 or 256M, I forget which
00:53 < chenwj> pm215: so that I can't use "-m xxM"
00:53 < pm215> this is imposed by the physical memory map of the system
00:53 < pm215> qemu doesn't do any sanity check that you haven't asked for more RAM than the board supports, so if you try it it will just crash in some
               unhelpful way
00:54 < chenwj> pm215: you means versatilepb shouldn't have that much memory in theory?
00:54 < pbrook> The versatile/pb only has a 256Mb address window for RAM. as pm215 says, bad thing will happen if you exceed that.
00:55 < chenwj> well, it works (at least it boot)
00:55 < pm215> chenwj: yes. "-M versatilepb -m 2048M" is a user error
00:55 < pbrook> You could in theory put additional ram elsewhere, but at that point you're no longer emulating a Versatile/PB.
00:55  * chenwj faint
00:55 < pm215> this is pure fluke . we might make it actually give a proper error in some future version
00:55 < chenwj> pm215: so it's a bug then
00:56 < pm215> I tried to submit a patch ages ago that made boards define their max memory amount, but it got shot down
00:56 < pm215> but anyway, if you want more than 256M ram don't use versatilepb
00:56 < chenwj> actually, we want to run spec on it
00:57 < pbrook> I wouldn't bother.
