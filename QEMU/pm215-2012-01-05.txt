20:42 < chenwj> is it possible to debug a problematic codegen from the kernel panic message?
20:43 < pm215> sometimes
20:44 < pm215> if the panic is "we got an UNDEF exception in kernel mode" there's usually enough in the panic message to identify the instruction
20:44 < pm215> if it's merely that something's gone wrong at some point and eventually you've hit the panic, that's harder...
20:46 < chenwj> hmmmm... what I got is eip, registers' content, stack, call trace
20:47 < chenwj> are they fit your first case?
20:48 < pm215> you get that kind of thing for any panic. The question is "why did we panic", which is typically somewhere near the top
20:49 < chenwj> need find a way to scoll tightvnc' screen up
20:50 < soren_> vnc has no concept of scrolling.
20:51 < soren_> It's like saying you want your monitor to scroll up. It hasn't a clue. It just shows you some pixels.
20:56 < chenwj> soren_: "shift + pageup" will do
20:56 < chenwj> pm215: something like "unable to handle kernel page request at virtual address xxx"?
21:02 < pm215> yes. if you're vaguely familiar with kernel panic mesasges then you can put that together with the rest of the info to figure out what the
               kernel was doing at the immediate point of the problem
21:05 < chenwj> I guess qemu also put cross page constriant on "direct jump", right?
21:07 < chenwj> currenly, the differences between no-panic and panic one might be the direct jump (I guess)
22:20 < mjt> chenwj: shift+pageup is a guest feature not vnc. and in case of linux guest that works as long as no panic occured. if it occured linux
             disables all interrupts including keyboard so anything you hit on keyboard has no effect whatsoever.
22:20 < mjt> chenwj: the easiest way to see linux kernel panic message is to enable serial console
22:21 < chenwj> mjt: i see
22:35 < soren_> chenwj: Uh, no. shift+pageup tells Linux's console driver to scroll up. Not VNC. VNC hasn't a clue that it's scrolling anything.
22:35 < soren_> chenwj: And if you're trying to scroll to see a more info in a kernel crash, it's probably not going to work.
22:36 < mjt> soren: i just told him exactly that :)
22:36 < soren> mjt: Oh. So you did :)
22:37 < chenwj> mjt, soren thanks ;)
