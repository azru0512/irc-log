10:00 < chenwj> stefanha: there?
10:00 < chenwj> stefanha: I read your blog post about lxc -> http://blog.vmsplice.net/2012/09/thoughts-on-linux-containers-lxc.html
10:01 < chenwj> stefanha: but I still don't know when I should choose lxc or kvm. :(
10:09 < iggy> for most people it likely comes down to supporting one tool or two... so if you have not need to run anything other than Linux ever, lxc is
              a good fit
10:11 < chenwj> what I want is keeping the base (host) system clean, then play around in a container/vm, but at the same time make guest/host share as
                much as resource.
10:12 < iggy> probably lxc then
10:13 < iggy> (if as I said before, you only need Linux guests)
