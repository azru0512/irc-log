18:23 < chenwj> there is no such VMExit instruction just like VMLAUCH/VMRESUME for VMEntry, right?
18:42 < avi> chenwj, VMCALL
19:19 < chenwj> avi: I check kvm_vmx_exit_handlers, and VMCALL is just one of them. Let's say guest execute INVLPG, is it hw being trigger to go back to
                kvm, not executing any other VMExit-like instruction?
19:24 < chenwj> avi: and do we have to modified guest OS to use VMCALL?
19:24 < avi> it's already modified
19:25 < chenwj> you mean newer linux kernel, right?
19:26 < avi> yes
19:26 < avi> agraf, megasas segfaults immediately for me
19:26 < avi> unfortunately. gdb is confused
19:26 < agraf> avi: ugh
19:27 < agraf> avi: let me call hannes into here
19:28 < chenwj> avi: besides VMCALL, when guest execute instruction like invplg, the cpu automaically exit guest mode and back to kvm?
19:29 < hare> agraf: What now?
19:29 < avi> if the hardware is configured this way
19:29 < agraf> [1:26pm] avi: agraf, megasas segfaults immediately for me
19:29 < hare> avi: Oh?
19:29 < hare> avi: backtrace? Something?
19:29 < chenwj> avi: I see, thanks
19:29 < avi> hare, gdb just hangs on me
19:29 < avi> I'm looking at it
19:30 < hare> avi: can you enable tracing?
19:30 < hare> avi: I got tons of tracing for megasas; should help here.
19:30 < avi> it's during init. probably something stupid
19:30 < avi> guest not up yet
19:31 < avi> what's with this stupid gdb?
19:31 < hare> avi: during init? but surely the megasas code already been running, right?
