21:46 < agraf_> chenwj: GPUs usually have a bunch of context processing pipes that are reasonably separate of each other                                                                      21:46 < agraf_> chenwj: however, IIUC there's no memory protection between them
21:46 < agraf_> chenwj: (yet)
21:46 < agraf_> chenwj: if you're seriously interested, let's talk about this in private ;)
21:48 < chenwj> agraf_: definitely :)
21:48 <agraf_> alrighty :)
21:48 <agraf_> so there is some stuff in the works that I'm not allowed to talk about publically
21:48 <chenwj> totally understand :)
21:49 <agraf_> essentially, AMD is trying to get their GPUs fully context separated and integrated with the IOMMU
21:49 <agraf_> so that you can pass a virtual GPU context to your guest
21:49 <agraf_> mostly for GPGPU workloads
21:49 <agraf_> but IIUC there's very very little keeping you from actually using all of that for graphics virtualization
21:50 <agraf_> I can get you in touch with the relevant folks at AMD if you like
21:50 <chenwj> "pass a virtual GPU context to your guest" <- to guest or host?
21:50 <chenwj> sure
21:50 <agraf_> hrm
21:50 <agraf_> do you know what SR-IOV is?
21:50 <chenwj> nope
21:50 <agraf_> ok, so SR-IOV is a PCI standard
21:51 <agraf_> that allows you to get multiple virtual PCI devices from a single host PCI device
21:51 <chenwj> ok
21:51 <agraf_> imagine a 10GBit ethernet adapter
21:51 <agraf_> those beasts usually have a lot of queues to handle all this load
21:51 <agraf_> now, imagine you have 64 queues
21:51 <agraf_> you can either use 64 queues for one adapter
21:51 <agraf_> or split them to 64 adapters
21:52 <agraf_> so you can basically have 64 network adapters in your system
21:52 <agraf_> even though there's only a single card
21:52 <agraf_> the idea is the same
21:52 <chenwj> I see
21:53 <agraf_> just a bit more sophisticated
21:53 <agraf_> I don't know all the details myself, but the idea was to allow context switches on the GPU
21:53 <agraf_> and multiple channels to be devided
21:53 <agraf_> divided*
21:53 <agraf_> so you can either split your GPU in half and assign one to a guest and one to the host
21:53 <chenwj> pretty cool
21:53 <agraf_> or you can use the full thing and just context switch whenever you go out/in to the guest
21:54 <agraf_> but again, I only know that they're working on it, not of the technical details :)
21:55 <agraf_> are you a research student or assistant?
21:55 <chenwj> assistant :)
21:55 <agraf_> at which university? :)
21:56 <chenwj> http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/
21:56 <chenwj> It's not a university but a research center, I think
21:56 <agraf_> sinica?
21:56 <agraf_> ah :)
21:58 <chenwj> it's a Latin word, means "chinese"
21:58 <agraf_> oh
21:58 <agraf_> :)
21:59 <chenwj> so it's the same as "Chinese Academy"
21:59 <agraf_> nod :)
21:59 <chenwj> do you really mean it? -> "I can get you in touch with the relevant folks at AMD if you like"
21:59 <agraf_> alrighty, mail sent out
21:59 <agraf_> yeah, already done
21:59 <chenwj> cool, thanks
21:59 <agraf_> sure :)
22:00 <agraf_> Chris is the head of the open source center at AMD
22:00 <agraf_> Joerg is the maintainer for IOMMUs in the kernel, working in that center
22:01 <agraf_> I do know for a fact that they're both involved in that project, but I kept the mail open enough for them to deny it :)
22:03 <chenwj> the _big_ boss want us to give a proposal to AFOSR (US Air Force)
22:03 <chenwj> a 3 year project
22:03 <agraf_> sounds like a good fit then, no? :)
22:04 <chenwj> no idea, the deadline is March 7. They need to *real* and detailed proposal. :)
22:05 <agraf_> well, it's worth a try at least
22:05 <agraf_> I have no idea what the AFOSR really needs ;)
22:06 <chenwj> haha
