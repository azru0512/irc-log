15:05 < chenwj> I see a lot of stub in dlls/ntdll/ntdll.spec, does it mean those function are not implemented?
15:06 < nsivov> yes
15:07 < chenwj> hmmm... this implies windows app usually don't use this kind of function?
15:09 < nsivov> I think average windows application doesn't use ntdll directly at all
15:09 < nsivov> some do of course
15:14 < chenwj> does unix has something simliar to windows lpc (local procedure call)?
15:18 < Jhime> sounds a lot like a unix domain socket
15:41 < chenwj> when doing api emulation, does wine do any optimiztion or trick to speed up performance?
15:41 < Gentle> that question is weird
15:41 < ohsix> wine isn't an emulator
15:41 < Gentle> "no, wine tries desperately to slow down things wherever possible"?
15:42 < ohsix> and many funtions are stubs, which would do less than the real thing, but that's not always acceptable to the application, there aren't
               really many places where you can do tricks as i think you mean
15:42 < ohsix> because where there are, windows would do them to
15:42 < chenwj> hrm, I think I use the wrong term, let me say implementing WinAPI?
15:44 < Gentle> do you have any specific questions? As mentioned before, "does X do any optimizations" is not making much sense
15:49 < chenwj> I think ohsix somewhat answer my question. iiuc, wine implement lots of functions in kernel.dll ntdll.dll. and whemever possible, wine only
                implement upper function if it doen't change the functionality from applicaiton pov
15:50 < Gentle> no, that's not the reason
15:50 < chenwj> ?
15:51 < Gentle> there is no specification you could follow, so in the beginning, everything is a stub, and you implement those functions where it crashed
                until it doesn't crash anymore, and you repeat that for every program or crash you encounter
15:51 < Gentle> the stubs are not to speed up stuff, they are there because, most of the time, nobody knows exactly what this function should do
15:52 < chenwj> beacuse it's undoumented?
15:53 < Gentle> some are entirely undocumented, for the rest there is only a "this function takes X and returns Y" specification
15:54 < chenwj> ohsix: so I musunderstand what you said? :)
15:54 < Gentle> ohsix: and please correct me if anything is not correct, I don't want to spread half-wrong information
15:55 < Gentle> I think what he said was that technically, all those stubs might make wine faster than windows in some parts, but that comes with the price
                of simply not doing the right thing there
