10:49 < chenwj_> anyone here would like to help me understand linux /dev/mem?
11:11 < DucBlangis> chenwj_ what about it?
11:12 < DucBlangis> generally provides access to the system's physical memory.
11:12 < chenwj_> when I do this,
11:12 < chenwj_> unsigned char *map_base = mmap(NULL, 0xff, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0x20000); // fd is /dev/mem
11:12 < chenwj_> it means I can write phys addr 0x20000 - 0x200ff through map_base, right?
11:14 < DucBlangis> yea
11:14 < DucBlangis> just so you know there is also a bash channel that is pretty active
11:14 < DucBlangis> are you trying to cleanup?
11:15 < chenwj_> no, I am trying to read/write phys mem through /dev/mem. What's bash channel?
11:19 < DucBlangis> it is #bash
11:23 < eightyeight> that looks like C to me
11:23 < eightyeight> chenwj_: i think you would be better server with ##C here on freenode
11:24 < chenwj_> ok
12:24 < nico103> chenwj_: yes
12:25 < nico103> so to address 0x20001 you'd add one to map_base and dereference: *((char *)map_base + 1)
13:06 < brianpWins> eightyeight, Snader_LB: got nginx upgraded it solved my long response issue !
14:08 < chenwj_> nico103: thanks
