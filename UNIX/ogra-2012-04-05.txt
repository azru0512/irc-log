17:55 < chenwj> anyone knows the default passwd of http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/11.10/release/ubuntu-11.10-preinstalled-server-armel+omap4.img.gz?
17:55 < nimesh_accenture> LetoThe2nd: we'r trying to have DVB-T running thru Totem ., so we need GNome and GStreamer
17:55 < LetoThe2nd> is there one anyway?
17:56 < chenwj> LetoThe2nd: are you talking to me?
17:56 < LetoThe2nd> chenwj: was meant for you, yes.
17:58 < LetoThe2nd> nimesh_accenture: well, everybody needs a hobby.
17:59 < chenwj> LetoThe2nd: or I should ask what's the default logging account
17:59 < LetoThe2nd> chenwj: i don't know from top of my head, i just know it was super trivial and i always found in seconds.
18:00 < LetoThe2nd> chenwj: like username "ubuntu" or such.
18:00 < chenwj> ok...
18:00 < LetoThe2nd> chenwj: didn't you run through the install wizard anyway?
18:01 < chenwj> nope, I burn the pre-built image into the sd card
18:02 < LetoThe2nd> chenwj: on first boot it should *theoretically* run the installer.
18:04 < chenwj> well, apparently not :/
18:42 < ogra_> LetoThe2nd, well, server (as all preinstalleed images) resizes the partitions on first boot, installer runs on second
18:42 < LetoThe2nd> ogra_: ah.
18:42 < LetoThe2nd> chenwj: still following us?
18:42 < ogra_> but server does it exclusively on serial
18:42 < LetoThe2nd> ogra_: sure
18:42 < ogra_> it only enables tty logins after the installer went through
18:43 < av500> I have a doubt, how can we add compiz server to serial gles2, please explain me the steps
18:43 < ogra_> (can be changed by dropping the debian-installer option from the kernel cmdline btw ... in case anyone wants to do a tty install of server
18:43 < ogra_> LOL
18:43  * LetoThe2nd sends av500 some spice-enhanced chicken marsala.
18:44 < ogra_> compiz server on serial gleas needs the gnome module compiled into the kernel
18:44 < ogra_> cant work without that
18:44 < LetoThe2nd> ogra_: the s3cr3t aalib-gnome incantations...
18:45 < ogra_> hey, but aalib drops shadows if compiz is running ;)
18:45 < LetoThe2nd> for those out there in need of some fun: switch on your office printer, run bb | lpr.
18:46 < LetoThe2nd> ogra_: but the cube thing is so laggy! why doesn't aalib use my super cool 5 card array of radeonforce 0815HDs?
18:47 < ogra_> a cube has 6 sides, you need one more card !
18:47 < LetoThe2nd> *DANG*
18:59 < wbs> av500: right, will test
18:59 < av500> wbs: killing and restarting that should reload ducati
19:07 < wbs> av500: nice, that seems to work just fine
19:07 < wbs> and saves me a shitload of time when debugging stuff :-)
19:10 < av500> wbs: :)
19:10 < av500> you know, in the past it saved me a shitload of time when debugging stuff
19:12 < wbs> :-)
19:12 < LetoThe2nd> av500: why u debugging stuff?
19:14 < av500> LetoThe2nd: most of the time I am bugging stuff
19:14 < LetoThe2nd> sounds waaaaaaay more fun!
19:14 < av500> yes
19:21 < chenwj> LetoThe2nd: just back
19:22 < LetoThe2nd> chenwj: read up what ogra_ said, and if in doub, poke him.
19:22 < chenwj> LetoThe2nd: ok
22:41 < chenwj> ogra_: the resizing happened on the first boot, you said
22:42 < ogra_> right, it should print the progress on your serial console
22:42 < chenwj> what should I expect after "Resizing, pass: 1 [100/100]"
22:43 < ogra_> it should tell you it reboots into the configuration session
22:43 < ogra_> (might take a while, depending on the size of your SD it needs to write the buffer ... the LED next to the SD card should tell you if it
               still works on that)
22:43 < chenwj> ok
22:44 < chenwj> there are two led next to the sd card
22:44 < chenwj> the size of sd card is 32G
22:44 < chenwj> what's the eta
22:45 < av500> should be done by tea time
22:45 < chenwj> XD
22:45 < LetoThe2nd> av500: nov 05, 2013?
22:46  * ogra_ doesnt think we ever tested with more than 8G cards ...
22:46 < chenwj> ooops
22:46  * chenwj pray
