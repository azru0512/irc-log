22:56 < chenwj_> __gcc_personality_v0 is C personality routine?
22:56 < chenwj_> or C++?
22:57 < richi> the basic language independent one (so, C, yes)
22:58 < chenwj_> __gxx_personality_v0 is C++ specific?
22:59 < chenwj_> you say "basic language independent one", does this mean it can be used for any language?
22:59 < chenwj_> or just for languages have no their own personality routine?
22:59 < richi> it can be used for any language in some circumstances
23:01 < chenwj_> any document on it?
23:08 < t4nk382> hi
23:14 < iant> chenwj_: __gcc_personality_v0 is the C personality routine
23:14 < chenwj_> iant: but... richi> it can be used for any language in some circumstances
23:15 < iant> it can certainly appear in a program written predominantly in some other language, if that is what you are asking
23:15 < iant> because it can be used by C support routines linked into programs written in some other language
23:16 < iant> but it will not be used directly by anything other than the C compiler, as far as I know
23:18 < chenwj_> talk about personality routine, is there any document/article talk about it
23:19 < iant> chenwj_: there is http://www.airs.com/blog/archives/464
23:19 < chenwj_> for example, I'd like to know language has what personality routine
23:19 < chenwj_> iant: it's your blog! :)
23:19 < iant> well, yes
23:20 < iant> I don't know of any actual list of personality routines, but they mostly all have the language in the name, except for the C one
23:21 < chenwj_> you mean for lang A, its personality routine can be called "__A_personality_v0" something like that?
23:21 < iant> yes, the name can be anything but in practice that is what all the languages use
23:21 < chenwj_> i see
23:22 < chenwj_> one more question,
23:23 < chenwj_> cleanup attribute only works when we enable -fexceptions?
23:23 < iant> the cleanup attribute works either way if the function returns normally
23:24 < iant> if some exception is thrown by a called function, then the cleanup attribute only works if you use -fexceptions
23:24 < iant> as far as I know
23:24 < chenwj_> ok
23:24 < patrickm> Hello
23:24 < richi> iant: we drop to the C personality if it suffices
23:24 < chenwj_> hi
23:24 < richi> iant: see function_needs_eh_personality ()
23:25 < iant> richi: oh, thanks
23:27 < richi> was invented for cross-language LTO
23:28 < chenwj_> you mean function_needs_eh_personality?
23:28 < richi> yes
