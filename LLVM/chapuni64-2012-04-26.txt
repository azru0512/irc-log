21:44 < chapuni64> I have been becoming busy in this week :D
21:44 < chapuni64> chenwj: do you work as a lecturer or assistant?
21:44 < chenwj> it's Thur
21:44 < chenwj> research assistant
21:44 < chapuni64> for the PhD?
21:45 < chenwj> nope

21:46 < chenwj> more accurate, serve my military service
21:46 < chapuni64> aah!
21:46 < chapuni64> for two yrs?
21:46 < chenwj> 3
21:48 < chapuni64> excuse me for political topic, do you feel it would waste your time?
21:49 < chenwj> sometimes, but this job can let me play with llvm and qemu
21:50 < chenwj> so it's kind of trade-off
21:50 < chapuni64> heheh it would be wonderful in your country!
21:50 < chenwj> ?
21:50 < chapuni64> I didn't imagine that position in service
21:51 < chenwj> I didn't imagine that position in service <-  in military service?
21:51 < chapuni64> I gussed
21:52 < chenwj> it's a special military service. You work for company or research center as your military service
21:52 < pyknite> chenwj: are you swiss?
21:52 < chenwj> not usual soldier
21:53 < chenwj> pyknite: I come from taiwan

21:53 < espindola> chandlerc: how many Decls would you expect in http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1599012?
21:53 < chenwj> southeast island beside mainland china
21:53 < kmacy> heh
21:53 < kmacy> I would hope we all know where it is
21:54 < chenwj> well, I am not sure ;)
21:54 < chapuni64> of course I know where Taiwan is!
21:54 < chenwj> It's a tiny spot on the map
21:54 < kmacy> well
21:54 < kmacy> its independence is a thorn in the side of the PRC
21:54 < kmacy> so, it may be tiny
21:55 < kmacy> but it gets a fair amount of commentary
21:55 < chapuni64> Taiwan is known as "the beautiful tropical islang" :D
21:55 < chapuni64> *island
21:55 < kmacy> uhm
21:55 < jtcranme1> I can get most of the countries, although I'll fail in the central asian portion of the former USSR and the smaller countries of west
                   africa
21:55 < kmacy> if you say so
21:55 < pyknite> chenwj: oh ok... We have something like this system here too
21:55 < jtcranme1> and the Carribean
21:55 < kmacy> pyknite: what canton are you in?
21:56 < jcranmer> so much for "ignorant American" stereotypes :-P
21:56 < chenwj> chapuni64: are you work at Tokyo. I might attend LinuxCon Japan at Yakohama on 6/6 - 6/8

21:59 < kmacy> I lived on keihin kyuko, about 30min south of Yokosuka a long time ago
21:59 < kmacy> keihin kyukosen
21:59 < kmacy> between oppama and mutsuura
21:59 < chapuni64> Yokosuka! for cellular phone, or US marine?
21:59  * chapuni64 or Nissan...
21:59 < kmacy> exchange student at oppama koukou
22:00 < chapuni64> heh, it was good :D
22:00 < kmacy> hrrm?
22:00 < chenwj> chapuni64: perhaps I can meet u there :p
22:01 < chapuni64> I wont expect to attend then :(
22:01 < chenwj> nono, I mean go outside
22:01 < chapuni64> I could take dinner in Yokohama
22:01 < chenwj> cool
22:01 < chenwj> I am wondering where to eat
22:02 < chapuni64> kmacy: "It was the good opportunity for you!"
22:02 < kmacy> ahh
22:02 < kmacy> ok
22:02 < kmacy> yeah it was interesting
22:02 < kmacy> it was hhrrm
22:02 < kmacy> 23 years ago
22:02 < kmacy> ;D
22:02 < chenwj> wow
22:02 < kmacy> daibu mae no koto da
22:02 < chapuni64> Yokosuka is known as the town of US Navy (mistook, not Marine)
22:02 < kmacy> yup
22:03 < kmacy> I know
22:03 < kmacy> but I had no connection
22:03 < kmacy> I did manage to sneak on the base a couple of times through a hole in the fence
22:03 < kmacy> :D
22:03 < chapuni64> the hole is always important
22:05  * chapuni64 had the experienct that the military police tracked him at Sasebo, Kyushu :D
22:05 < chenwj> 0.o ?
22:05 < kmacy> something is lost in translation
22:05 < kmacy> :D
22:06 < chapuni64> I have to stop off-topic lol
22:06 < chenwj> :)
22:06 < pyknite> kmacy: Vaud
22:08 < kmacy> pyknite: ok, I guess with TI being less than half the population of San Francisco the odds of bumping in to someone from there online are
               pretty small
22:09 < pyknite> kmacy: TI?
22:09 < kmacy> ticino
22:09 < pyknite> oh ok.. I was looking for an acronyme ;)
22:09 < kmacy> ahh
