16:45 < chenwj_> hi
16:46 < chenwj_> when I enable wchar support, I get error msg below
16:46 < chenwj_> checking size of wchar_t... 0
16:46 < chenwj_> configure: error: There is wchar.h but the size of wchar_t is 0
16:46 < Jacmet> kos_tom: heh
16:46 < chenwj_> any idea where should I look into?
16:46 < Jacmet> chenwj_: during building fo what package?
16:46 < Jacmet> of even
16:46 < chenwj_> icu
16:47 < Jacmet> chenwj_: did you rebuild everything after adding wchar support? (make clean; make)
16:47 < chenwj_> nope
16:47 < chenwj_> trying...
16:47 < Jacmet> chenwj_: wchar is a core part of the toolchain/C library, so you need to rebuild it all when you change it
16:48 < chenwj_> ok
17:06 < chenwj_> if I want to add new board support (for qemu), is there a template config I can start with?
17:08 < kos_tom> see configs/
17:09 < kos_tom> and board/qemu/
17:09 < kos_tom> which Qemu board do you want to add
17:09 < kos_tom>  ?
17:09 < chenwj_> realview-pbx-a9
17:10 < chenwj_> so I need create new config for configs/ AND board/qemu/ ?
17:11 < chenwj_> http://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg109179.html <- what I am trying to do
17:14 < kos_tom> configs/ is for the Buildroot defconfig
17:14 < kos_tom> board/qemu/arm-realview-pbx-a9/ is where you will put the kernel configuration files and a readme.txt file explaining how to run the Qemu
                 system
17:19 < chenwj_> what I did is `make qemu_arm_versatile_defconfig` first, then point it to use realview-pbx-a9 kernel config
17:19 < chenwj_> is it not enough?
17:28 < kos_tom> probably yes.
17:29 < chenwj_> any idea what I might miss?
17:33 < kos_tom> your kernel configuration is most likely incorrect.
17:34 < chenwj_> I use $LINUX_SRC/arch/arm/configs/
18:15 < kos_tom> that's not a configuration, that's a directory
18:15 < kos_tom> if you want help, please pastebin your Buildroot .config
19:44 < gustavoz> chenwj_: you need any a9 under qemu or some particular one?
19:45 < gustavoz> realview-pbx-a9 is problematic, vexpress-a9 generally works
19:45 < chenwj_> ah
19:45 < chenwj_> gustavoz: thanks for the info, I'll check it :)
19:47 < gustavoz> chenwj_: the defconfig needs a tweak since it doesn't seem to emulate a disk though
00:20 < chenwj_> does buildroot provide ssh package?
00:22 < chenwj_> ah, openssh
00:43 < trem> dropbear
00:47 < chenwj_> I install openssh, but it always ask me to chang passwd
00:48 < chenwj_> trem: ^ is it a known issue?
00:49 < trem> I don't know
00:49 < chenwj_> ok
01:03 < j0wn> Hello all,  I posted to the buildroot mailing list,  If I include the packages for a native compiler the build fails with a dbus/dbus-shared.h
              error regarding libglib2.
01:19 < j0wn> I have tried with different releases of build root ( lates and git ),  is there an easy fix for this ?,  just to add I took a look at my local
              system I have a dbus-1 directory in lib include the shared header is there.  I was sure if it was looking at my host or the build tree.
              Thanks in advance.
01:34 < chenwj_> I think buildroot doesn't support java, right?
01:38 < gustavoz> no java, nobody cared about maintaining it
01:41 < chenwj_> no replacement? I mean I just need jre
01:45 < gustavoz> unmaintained + broken = no
01:45 < chenwj_> I see
01:46 < gustavoz> you may be able to use some of the binary-only ones if your architecture is one of the "normal" (built for) ones, and if you're using a
                  glibc/eglibc toolchain, and if you take time to do so
01:47 < gustavoz> if jamvm is enough for you it may be possible to get it back and into shape, but that would require someone caring (which got us into the
                  "no java" scenario to begin with)
01:47 < chenwj_> arm is normal? :)
01:47 < gustavoz> nope, just x86 & x86_64 would be, oracle doesn't care about arm
01:48 < gustavoz> sparc too, but then for solaris, not linux :)
01:48 < chenwj_> ok
01:50  * chenwj_ -> zzz
